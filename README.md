# aws-jenkins

Provision AWS VPC, public subnet, security group, route table and association, and an EC2 instance, and install Jenkins



## Prerequisites

[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)


## Provision Jenkins on EC2

Create a key pair to SSH into EC2 
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem -f jenkins_kp && openssl rsa -in jenkins_kp -outform pem && chmod 400 jenkins_kp.pem
```

### Local usage

Grab your IP address from `https://checkip.amazonaws.com/` to use in `TF_VAR_local_ip` below.

Set environment variables in the terminal for the cloud storage
```
export TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io=<REDACTED> 
export TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION=vantage-point-global 
export TF_WORKSPACE=aws-jenkins
export TF_VAR_local_ip=<READACTED>
```

Initialise Terraform
```
terraform init
```

Create a Terraform plan
```
terraform plan
```

Apply the plan
```
terraform apply
```

Note the public_ip in the terminal output
